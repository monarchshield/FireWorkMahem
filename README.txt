Just some side work that i do if im ever bored:
Objective is to port it to iphone or android using xamarin 
if it ever gets somewhere :P
Game uses Monogame framework:

Though il probably now switch over to converting this back into c++ and using Marmalade
else will probably look into alternatives like unity for porting
